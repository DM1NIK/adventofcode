# adventofcode with some special conditions

# Conditions for paper experience.

- no library import allowed
- no IDE allowed (no autocomplete or highlighting)
- no cursor up movement allowed
- only enter and tab are allowed to move the cursor (except for writing code itself)

# Reason
My exam is on paper.
